## Summary

This PIP proposes a backwards compatible addressing scheme to facilitate Layer-2 addresses as well as improve current Layer-1 payments and general usage.

## Motivation

PascalCoin current allows users to send/receive operations between accounts using their account numbers (PASA) as a reference. These account numbers are typically post-fixed with a checksum to avoid data entry errors. 

This proposal extends this specification to allow the embedding of a payload to an address. This allows a recipient to specify the payload the sender must enter when sending an operation. This is useful in many current use-cases such as a merchant specifying the payload code in the buyers transaction so that he can recognize it. Also, for exchanges to specify the payload for users to deposit. By using these addresses, a single PASA can be represented in many forms. 

Most importantly, Layer-2 applications require this as an addressing scheme for Layer-2 applications. As a result, this PIP proposes a formal specification for these addresses.

## Specification

Layer-2 addresses will be herein referred to as Extended PASA, or E-PASA for short.

### Extended PASA format (E-PASA)

An Extended PASA is defined by the below EBNF grammar:

    EPASA          = PASA [ExtensionSpec]  
    PASA            = Integer-Checksum
    Checksum        = Integer
    ExtensionSpec   = "[" Payload "]" [PayloadChecksum] 
    Payload         = PayloadType EncryptionType "-" PayloadContent
    PayloadType     = "H" | "B" | "A"
    EncryptionType  = "N" | "S" | "R" | "P" Password
    Password        = "!"" ASCII-String "!"
    PayloadContent  = HexPayload | Base58Payload | ASCIIPayload
    PayloadChecksum = ":" Integer
    HexPayload      = "0" "x" HEXADECIMAL-String
    Base58Payload   = BASE58-String
    ASCIIPayload    = "'" ASCII-String "'"

The above rules are explained as follows:

| Rule            | Explanation                                                                                              |
| --------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| EPASA           | This is a layer-2 address, fully backwards compatible as Layer-1 address                                 |
| PASA            | This is the standard layer-1 address of an account                                                       |
| Checksum        | This is the standard layer-1 address checksum                                                            |
| ExtensionSpec   | The specification of the extended PASA portion (payload, how to encrypt, etc)                            |
| Payload         | The fully qualified payload                                                                              |
| PayloadType     | The format the payload will be specified in (H = Hex, B = Base58, A = ASCII)                             |
| EncryptionType  | The type of encryption used on the payload (N = None, S = Senders Key, R = Recipients Key, P = password) |
| Password        | The password used for AES256 encrypted payloads                                                          |
| PayloadContent  | The actual payload data, specified it it's correct form                                                  |
| PayloadChecksum | An optional 32bit MurMur3 hash of the Payload                                                            |
| HexPayload      | A hexadecimal-encoded string used when specifying a payload in hexadecimal, prefixed with 0x             |
| Base58Payload   | A base58 encoded string used when specifying a payload in base58                                         |
| ASCIIPayload    | An ASCII-encoded string used when specifying a payload in ASCII                                          |

#### Payload Checksumming

In order to avoid data entry errors, the payload portion is **optionally** checksummed. The payload checksum is calculated as follows:

```
    PayloadChecksum = Format-As-4-Digit-Number(  MurMur3( Payload.ToString  ) MOD 10000 )
```

The MurMur3 used here is the 32bit version. The hash digest is **Payload** portion of the E-PASA inASCII form (i.e. the text between square brackets). The Checksum by convention is padded to 4 digits and it's range constrained to 0000 - 9999.

## Examples

### Example 1 

```
123456-77[HN0x12ab3f] 
```

- Address is '123456-77'
- Payload is the hexadecimal string 0x12ab3f
- Payload is not encrypted (public)
- No payload checksum included

**Note**
 - To encrypt using senders key, address would be ```123456-77[HS0x12ab3f]```.
 - To encrypt using recipients key, address would be ```123456-77[HR0x12ab3f]```.
 - To encrypt using password "Alpha$", address would be ```123456-77[HP!Alpha$!0x12ab3f]```.
 - To add a checksum, address would be ```123456-77[HN0x12ab3f]:9876```


### Example 2: 

```
77-44[AN'herman@email.com']:1234 
```

- Layer-1 address is '77-44'
- Payload is the ASCII string "herman@email.com"
- Payload is not encrypted (public)
- Payload checksum is "1234"

**NOTE**
- By using recipients key, ```77-44[AR'herman@email.com']:5678``` exchanges could use such addresses to accept users deposits easily, via a single address per user.

## Rationale

The design approach was to remain backwards compatible in order to allow existing JSON API's to simply accept E-PASA addresses and which automatically fill out the payload fields.

## Backwards Compatibility

This PIP is backwards compatible and does not requier a hard-fork activation, only an implementation change.
